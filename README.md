# Nand2Tetris
My solutions to the problem sets in the NAND2Tetris course (http://www.nand2tetris.org). Each folder represents a distinct problem set. Unless explicitly stated, all of the contents, except the header comments from the NAND2Tetris staff, are my own work.

The course guides "students and self-learners through the construction of a modern, full-scale computer system - hardware and software - from the ground up" (http://www.nand2tetris.org/about.php). The course starts with constructing elementary logic chips using NAND gates, before moving to the construction of (simulated) hardware components such as registers, RAM, program counters, ALUs, CPUs, and memory-maps, through to assembly language and the construction of an assembler, compilation and the construction of a compiler, and finishing with a high-level programming language. The end result is a simulated von Neumann architecture computer with a keyboard input and monitor output, running programs written in a high level language, every part of which -- both hardware and software -- having been constructed through the problem sets.
